# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# supplier = Supplier.new(name: "Costco", email: "costco@email.com", phone_number: "235-321-5658")
# supplier.save

# supplier = Supplier.new(name: "Best Buy", email: "best_buy@email.com", phone_number: "956-856-8621")
# supplier.save
